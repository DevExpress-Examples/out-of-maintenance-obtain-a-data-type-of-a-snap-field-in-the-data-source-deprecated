# How to obtain a data type of a field in the data source bound to SnapControl

> **Note**
>
> As you may already know, the [WinForms Snap control](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/11373/controls-and-libraries/snap) and [Snap Report API](https://docs.devexpress.com/OfficeFileAPI/15188/snap-report-api) are now in maintenance support mode. No new features or capabilities are incorporated into these products. We recommend that you use [DevExpress Reporting](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/2162/reporting) tool to generate, edit, print, and export your business reports/documents.

This example uses theÂ <a href="http://help.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/clsDevExpressSnapServicesDataAccessServicetopic">DevExpress.Snap.Services.DataAccessService</a>Â service to obtainÂ the type of a field in a data source by the field name.
